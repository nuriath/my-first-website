       A puppy is a juvenile dog. Some puppies can weigh 1-1.5 kg 
       (1-3 lb), while larger ones can weigh up to 7-11 kg (15-23 lb). 
       All healthy puppies grow quickly after birth. A puppy's coat color 
       may change as the puppy grows older, as is commonly seen in breeds 
       such as the Yorkshire Terrier. In vernacular English, puppy refers 
       specifically to dogs,[1] while pup may often be used for other mammals
        such as seals, giraffes, guinea pigs, or even rats or sharks.</p>

        <h3>Development</h3>
        <p>Born after an average of 63 days of gestation, puppies 
        emerge in an amnion that is bitten off and eaten by the
        mother dog.[3] Puppies begin to nurse almost immediately.
        If the litter exceeds six puppies, particularly if one or
        more are obvious runts, human intervention in hand-feeding
        the stronger puppies is necessary to ensure that the runts
        get proper nourishment and attention from the mother. 
        As they reach one month of age, puppies are gradually weaned
        and begin to eat solid food. The mother may regurgitate 
        partially digested food for the puppies or might let them eat some of her solid 
        food.[4] The mother dog usually refuses to nurse at this stage, 
        though she might let them occasionally nurse for comfort.</p>
