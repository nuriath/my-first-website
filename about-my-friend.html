    <p>You share a very close and special bond with your best
         friend. Your best friend is the person with whom you
          can share so much about what is happening in your life. 
          When you are happy it is your best friend with whom you 
          want to share your happiness. And when there is sorrow or 
          trouble you are facing it is your best friend who comes 
          forward to help you.</p>
    <p>Likewise, when your best friend is suffering any trouble 
        you will go to any extent to help your friend and make 
        her or him happy and comfortable. The love you share with 
        your best friend is unconditional. Your best friend is one
         person you will never let down. A true friendship that 
         you share with your best friend is like a treasure, and 
         you will always protect it and cherish it. </p>
